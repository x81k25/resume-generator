# prompts
## resume generator prompts
### skills extraction
tech_skills_extraction_prompt: |
  - Extract the technical skills required within this job description: {role_description} 
  - Examples of technical skills I would like to capture: 
  - The definition of technical skills in this context does not include languages and cloud tools per se, but what is to be done with those tools.
  - Output should be a JSON array of strings.
  {json_form_clause}

tech_tools_extraction_prompt: |
  - Extract all technology tools, e.g. coding languages, cloud development tools, and any specific development methodologies required within this job description: {role_description} 
  - Output should be a JSON array of strings.
  - Any skills within this list must be included: {key_skills}
  {json_form_clause}

soft_skills_extraction_prompt: |
  - Extract the key soft skills from this job description: {role_description} 
  - Output should be a JSON array of strings.
  {json_form_clause}

### skill selection
select_all_experience_prompt: |
  - from this list: {experience} 
  - select any of the elements that are in any way related to these skills: {skills}  
  - at least {experience_count} elements must be selected. 
  {json_form_clause}

select_most_relevant_experience_prompt: |
  - from this list of experiences: {experience} 
  - select the {experience_count} most relevant entries that correspond to these skills: {skills} 
  {json_form_clause} 

### extract hard skills
extract_hard_skills_prompt: |
  - ingest these inputs:
    <experience>: {experience}
    <skills>: {skills}          

  - you will categorize the extracted skills into the following <category>:
    1. Programming Languages and Libraries
    2. Cloud, Open-Source, and Database
    3. Data Science Techniques
    4. Data Visualization and Analysis

  - rules for inclusion/exclusion form each <category>:
    1. Programming Languages and Libraries
      - examples: Python, R, pandas, tensorflow
    2. Cloud, Open-Source, and Database
      - AWS, Azure, SQL, dbt, Snowflake, Docker, EC2, S3, Google Cloud Storage 
    3. Data Science Techniques
      - unsupervised learning, supervised learning, regression, classification, clustering
      - do not include any coding libraries here, e.g. do not include pandas, numpy, or tensorflow
    4. Data Visualization and Analysis
      - include data visualization tools only
      - examples: Tableau, PowerBI, ggplot, matplotlib, seaborn
      - do not include any data science libraries that are not solely used for data visualization 

  -Include only the following types of skills:
    - Programming languages, frameworks, and libraries
    - Software tools and platforms
    - Statistical and mathematical methods
    - Data processing techniques
    - Machine learning algorithms
    - Database technologies
    - Technical protocols and standards

  -Exclude all of the following:
    - Soft skills (e.g., leadership, communication)
    - Business terms and processes
    - Project management terminology
    - Team or interpersonal terms

  - follow these rules when extracting and categorizing:
    - the tools needed will always be within the "how" key:value pair 
    - extract only explicitly mentioned technical terms
    - group similar items next to each e.g. Python, pandas, sckilit-learn; AWS, EC2, S3
    - when grouping similar items next to each, always put the parent items first
      -examples:
        - Python, pandas, scikit-learn (Pandas is the parent language, and the other elements are python libraries)
        - AWS, EC2, S3 (AWS is the name of the service, provider, and EC2 and S3 are services provided by AWS)
    - use the categories provided and only the categories provided
    - verify each term appears in the source text

  - process the elements points as follows:
    - Read through all the bullet points carefully
    - Identify and extract technical skills based on the inclusion criteria
    - Categorize each skill into one of the provided categories
    - Group related tools and technologies as specified
    - Verify that each extracted term appears in the original text
    
  -select which items item to choose based on these criteria in order
    - each item should only appear in 1 <category> 
    - include all items that appear in <skills> and <experience>
    - prioritize items that appear multiple times in <experience>
    - de-emphasize items that appear only once in <experience> especially if they do not appear in <skills>
    - if there are more than 10 items in a <category>, delete the items based on the above criteria
    - verify that every itme used appears in <experience> at least once

  - present your final output as a JSON object with the following structure:
  {{
      "Programming Languages and Libraries": "item1, item2, item3, item4",
      "Cloud, Open-Source, and Database Tools": "item1, item2, item3, item4",
      "Data Science Techniques": "item1, item2, item3",
      "Data Visualization and Analysis": "item1, item2, item3",
  }}

  - ensure that:
    - The output is valid JSON
    - Categories are used as keys
    - Values are single comma-separated strings
    - There are no comments, notes, or additional text outside of the [] of the JSON array
    - Provide only the JSON object as your final output, with no additional text or commentary.

### ensure content is derived from actual experience
verify_experience_prompt: |
  - ingest these inputs 
    <original_experience>: {original_experience}
    <extracted_experience>: {extracted_experience}
    <experience_count>: {experience_count}
    <skills>: {skills}
  
  - ensure that the general content of everything contained within <extracted_experience> is contained in some form or fashion within <original_experience>
  - if it is not remove and extract another experience from <original_experience> that pertains to <skills> until the total number of experience is equal to <experience_count>
  {json_form_clause} 


### format experience
format_experience_prompt: |
  - ingest these inputs:
    <skills>: {skills}
    <experience>: {experience}
  
  - for each experience in the <experience>, create a sentence using this structure:
     - begin with a technical action verb derived from the "what" aspect
     - include implementation details from the "how" aspect
     - emphasize how items from <experience> that are also included in <skills>
     - remove or de-emphasize how items from <experience> that are not present in <skills>
     - state the business purpose or context
     - end with the result
  
  - individual sentence output formatting instructions:
     - use the CAR format for resume writing
     - attempt make each sentence AST optimized
         - but do not remove highly relevant content of elements with <skills> in order to reach AST compliance
     - do not include titles or context prefixes for the array
     - do not include the parenthesis from the how section; replace with natural language
  
  - for the collections of outputs as a whole
     - avoid excessive repetition
          - if two subsequent action verbs are identical, alter the second to be a slightly different verb
          - using different verbs when referring to tools used, e.g. don't say "using Python" in every bullet point
     - if the same skill is used for multiple bullet points, make sure to include other how items to reduce over-repetition
     - select the ordering of the sentences based on the relevance to the <skills>
  
  - output formatting
     - output will be JSON
     - output an array of string
     - output one string for each input "experience"
     - output no characters outside of the closing array bracket, i.e. []
  
  commence operation
